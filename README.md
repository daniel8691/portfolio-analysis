# portfolio-analysis

For this project, I will use series of calculations and models that
considers both risk and returns of the securities within my portfolio. These calculations will allow me to make well-informed decisions
that is backed by data and hopefully maximize my investment returns. 
I will mostly focus on using the securities' variance and mean for the analysis. Dividends are also not accounted for in the analysis

When I calculate the annualized returns, I use 250 days because I am not including the days when the markets are closed

The defined risk for this analysis is the standard deviation of the stock which will be used to describe the volatility of the security
Securities that have high volatilities are deemed higher risk


After constructing the efficient frontier, I found that the plot is negatively correlated, meaning that for this set of portfolio, the more risk I 
take, the less return I will receive. This may be possible because RBC and BCE are calculated to have low risk while producing high returns while 
the rest of the securities within the portfolio don't really produce high returns but bear higher risks than RBC and BCE

Looking at the plot, it can be said that if the structure of the portfolio is more weighted towards RBC and BCE, I will receive a higher return
on my investment, hence the negative correlation.

A major factor not included in this analysis is the dividend payouts. BPY enjoys a more luxurious dividend payout than the rest of the securities 
in the portfolio so even though my normalized plot displays BPY, along with SU, as low-return securities, their poor performance can be justified. 

When Calculating the Beta of the stock, I took the past 5 years of data because the companies' capital expenditures and business model are more recent.

Looking at the Sharpe Ratio, I can see that RY has the highest Sharpe ratio among other securities in the portfolio. I used the Sharpe Ratio 
to find out the risk-adjusted performance of the individual securities. With the standard deviation as the denominator, the higher 
a security's standard deviation (volatility) the lower the Sharpe Ratio will be.
